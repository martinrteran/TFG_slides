  abstract={Germanium P-I-N photovoltaic cells, with active areas of 1.1 cm<sup>2</sup>, for use at the high power densities encountered in thermo-photo-voltaic energy conversion systems have been analyzed, fabricated, and tested. This structure has interdigitated contacts located on the unilluminated side of the device to prevent optical masking. Junctions were alloyed at low temperatures (430Â°C) in order to preserve the free carrier lifetime of the intrinsic region.},
