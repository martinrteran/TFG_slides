abstract = {In modern societies, development level and economic well-being of a society are directly measured by energy generation and consumption. Energy plays an important role in the economic health of a country that is reflected by the gross national product (GNP). The per capita GNP of a country is correlated to the per capita energy consumption. There is a steady demand to increase the energy generation capacity all over the world since the global energy consumption is rising. The main reasons are the technological developments, industrial revolution, and increase in population.}
