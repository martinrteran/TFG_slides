abstract = {In this contribution, photonic energy production systems and applications are introduced and discussed comparatively. A focus is placed on the photosensitive materials and photocatalysts. The theory behind the photonic energy production process is provided in detail. The types of photoresponsive materials ranging from crystalline to polymer-based materials are also presented and compared for various applications. Furthermore, thermodynamic analyses and performance assessments through energy and exergy approaches are presented. Moreover, a case study is performed for photo-thermo-electrical processes inside the photovoltaic cell from energy and exergy analyses perspective.}
