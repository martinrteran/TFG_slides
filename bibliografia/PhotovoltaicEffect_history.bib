abstract = {In this chapter utility of biopolymer electrolytes in solar and electrochemical cells is discussed. General information related to the solar cells such as types, operating principle, electrode and electrolyte materials used, transport mechanism of electrolytes are given. The application of blend, composite, gel, and solid biopolymer electrolytes in DSSCs is also included. A brief introduction to the subject of batteries is provided. The need of biopolymer electrolytes and various aspects related to the use of different biopolymer electrolytes in batteries is discussed.}
