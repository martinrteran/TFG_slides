abstract = {Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is the direct conversion of radiant heat into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. TPV is perfectly suited for energy conversion at ultrahigh temperatures of well beyond 1000Â°C, where thermal radiation is the major heat transfer mechanism. In this temperature range TPV holds the highest thermal-to-electric energy conversion efficiency among solid-state energy converters and subsequently the highest conversion efficiency among all types of small-sized heat engines. This chapter briefly reviews the state-of-the-art and historical development of this technology, from fundamentals to practical implementations, and new conceptual designs aimed for increasing the power density and conversion efficiency of current devices.}
