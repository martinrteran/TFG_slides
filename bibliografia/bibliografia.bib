abstract = {Abstract Thermionic energy converters are solid-state heat engines that have the potential to produce electricity with efficiencies of over 30\% and area-specific power densities of 100 Wcm−2. Despite this prospect, no prototypes reported in the literature have achieved true efficiencies close to this target, and many of the most recent investigations report power densities on the order of mWcm−2 or less. These discrepancies stem in part from the low-temperature (<1300 K) test conditions used to evaluate these devices, the large vacuum gap distances (25–100 µm) employed by these devices, and material challenges related to these devices' electrodes. This review will argue that, for feasible electrode work functions available today, efficient performance requires generating output power densities of >1 Wcm−2 and employing emitter temperatures of 1300 K or higher. With this result in mind, this review provides an overview of historical and current design architectures and comments on their capacity to realize the efficiency and power potential of thermionic energy converters. Also emphasized is the importance of using standardized efficiency metrics to report thermionic energy converter performance data.},

TPV is perfectly suited for energy conversion at ultrahigh temperatures of well beyond 1000°C, where thermal radiation is the major heat transfer mechanism. In this temperature range TPV holds the highest thermal-to-electric energy conversion efficiency among solid-state energy converters and subsequently the highest conversion efficiency among all types of small-sized heat engines.

The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 ± 1)\% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 °C. A 1.2/1.0 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 ± 1)\% operating at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 °C. These cells can be integrated into a TPV system for thermal energy grid storage to enable dispatchable renewable energy.

abstract = {Industrial waste heat is examined in EU countries, focusing on the amount that can be recovered and exploited, referred to as technical potential of waste heat. An alternative methodology is proposed here, which is based on waste heat fractions derived from a detailed study of the UK industry from the period 2000–2003. These fractions express the part of heat consumption that is wasted and is possible to be recovered. The waste heat fractions have been calculated in this work for each main industrial sector and temperature level. The methodology initially includes the adjustment of waste heat fractions from each industrial sector from the UK industry to the conditions of the different EU countries in the period 2000–2003, in order to account for the different levels of energy efficiency. The second step is to adjust the fractions for the year 2015, using data about the evolution of energy intensity values from 2000 to 2003 to 2015 for each country and sector, resulting to a new set of fractions per country, temperature level and sector. This methodology has enabled the authors to study in detail the waste heat potential per sector and temperature level, using the most recent data. The main outcome is the estimation of waste heat potential for each main industrial sector in the EU, broken down to the amount of waste heat for each temperature range. A similar analysis is conducted for each EU country as well, in order to identify the magnitude of heat recovery opportunities that could exist for every industrial sector at country level. The main result of this analysis is the estimation of the total waste heat potential in EU, which is about 300 TWh/year, with one third corresponding to temperature level below 200 °C, which is often referred to as low-temperature waste heat, another 25\% in the range 200–500 °C and the rest above 500 °C (mostly in the range 500–1000 °C). The findings of the current study can be used for assessing the potential of any relevant heat recovery applications, such as heat upgrade and re-use or heat-to-power conversion technologies.}

abstract = {The thermal conductivities of silicon and germanium have been determined using the non-stationary hot wire method. Measurements were carried out over the temperature range 293–1724K on solid and liquid silicon and on liquid germanium in alumina tube. For solid silicon, the thermal conductivities were about 139W/mK at 293K and 19W/mK at 1573K and displayed temperature dependence steeper than T−1, where T is the temperature. Calculation of thermal conductivities for solid silicon based upon isotope, three-phonon and four-phonon scatterings indicates that phonon conduction dominates heat conduction at temperatures below 1000K. At temperatures above 1000K, on the contrary, contributions from electron, hole and electron–hole pair to heat conduction became greater progressively with a temperature rise. For liquid silicon, the thermal conductivity was about 57W/mK at 1700K and exhibited a slight increase with an increase in temperature. The thermal conductivity of liquid germanium was about 43W/mK at 1273K and slightly increased with increasing temperature. In both liquids, temperature dependency of thermal conductivity values was discussed from the view point of the Wiedemann–Franz law.}}

In this paper, the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 thin film was systematically investigated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. In addition to the size effect and the temperature effect for thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 thin films, the effect of defects induced thermal conductivity tuning was also examined. It was found that the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 thin films is insensitive to the temperature from −55 °C to 150 °C. Nevertheless, in the range of the thickness in this work, the thermal conductivity of the crystalline SiO2 (c-SiO2) thin films conforms to the T−α with the exponent range from −0.12 to −0.37, and the thinner films are less sensitive to temperature. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 with thickness beyond 4.26 nm has no significant size effect, which is consistent with the experimental results. Compared with c-SiO2 thin film, the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 is less sensitive to defects. Particularly, the effect of spherical void defects on the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 is followed by Coherent Potential model, which is helpful for the design of low-K material based porous a-SiO2 thin film in microelectronics.},

abstract = {Summary
Despite the relevance of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) conversion to many emerging energy technologies, identifying which aspects of current TPV designs are favorable and where opportunities for improvement remain is challenging because of the experimental variability in TPV literature, including emitter and cell temperatures, cavity geometry, and system scale. This review examines several decades of experimental TPV literature and makes meaningful comparisons across TPV reports by comparing each energy-conversion step to its respective, experiment-specific thermodynamic limit. We find that peak reported efficiencies are nearing 50\% of their thermodynamic limit. Emitter-cell pairs that best manage the broad spectrum of thermal radiation exhibit the best efficiencies. Large gains in peak efficiency are expected from further suppression of sub-bandgap radiative transfer, as well as improvements in carrier management that address bandgap underutilization and Ohmic losses. Furthermore, there is a noticeable practical gap between the leading material pairs and integrated devices, mainly due to a lack of scaled-up high-performance materials, which exposes surfaces to parasitic heat loss. Provided these challenges are overcome, TPVs may ultimately provide power on demand and near the point of use, enabling greater integration of intermittent renewables.}

abstract = {Solid-state heat-to-electrical power converters are thermodynamic engines that use fundamental particles, such as electrons or photons, as working fluids. Virtually all commercially available devices are thermoelectric generators, in which electrons flow through a solid driven by a temperature difference. Thermophotovoltaics and thermionics are highly efficient alternatives relying on the direct emission of photons and electrons. However, the low energy flux carried by the emitted particles significantly limits their generated electrical power density potential. Creating nanoscale vacuum gaps between the emitter and the receiver in thermionic and thermophotovoltaic devices enables a significant enhancement of the electron and photon energy fluxes, respectively, which in turn results in an increase of the generated electrical power density. Here we propose a thermionic-enhanced near-field thermophotovoltaic device that exploits the simultaneous emission of photons and electrons through nanoscale vacuum gaps. We present the theoretical analysis of a device in which photons and electrons travel from a hot LaB6-coated tungsten emitter to a closely spaced BaF2-coated InGaAs photovoltaic cell. Photon tunnelling and space charge removal across the nanoscale vacuum gap produce a drastic increase in flux of electrons and photons, and subsequently, of the generated electrical power density. We show that conversion efficiencies and electrical power densities of ∼ 30\% and ∼ 70 W/cm2 are achievable at 2000 K for a practicable gap distance of 100 nm, and thus greatly enhance the performances of stand-alone near-field thermophotovoltaic devices (∼10\% and ∼10 W/cm2). A key practical advantage of this nanoscale energy conversion device is the use of grid-less cell designs, eliminating the issue of series resistance and shadowing losses, which are unavoidable in conventional near-field thermophotovoltaic devices.}

abstract = {This article provides an in-depth review of charge transport models utilized to analyze the performance of near-field thermophotovoltaic (NF-TPV) devices, and a comprehensive examination of NF-TPV experiments performed to date. Researchers have used several models to theoretically analyze NF-TPV devices; however, each model can result in different performances of NF-TPV devices, particularly due to characteristics of near-field thermal radiation. For clarification, we sort up-to-date analysis models into four categories; the analytical approximation model, detailed balance analysis, minority carrier separation (MCS) model, and Poisson-drift–diffusion (PDD) model. Key assumptions of each model are enumerated, and the calculated results by each model are compared. For the review of experimental works, we first sort NF-TPV experiments according to the manner of gap control into positioner-, spacer-, and MEMS-based approaches. Then, we introduce the primary design configuration of each approach and the compelling experimental results achieved by state-of-the-art studies. In addition, advanced concepts of hybrid devices and multi-junction PV cells, proposed to further improve NF-TPV performance, are briefly introduced.}

ABSTRACT = {Thermophotovoltaics is a promising technology for heat recovery and has garnered tremendous attention in the last decades. This work theoretically evaluates the performance of a thermophotovoltaic system equipped with refractory all-ceramic selective thermal emitters made of boron carbide, silicon carbide and beryllium oxide for a high working temperature of 2000 &#8728;C, which corresponds to the external quantum efficiency of a SiC/Si tandem cell. The influence of thickness and filling ratio on the emissivity of thermal emitters over the wavelength ranging from 0.2 &mu;m to 2.5 &mu;m is studied. The corresponding spectral heat flux and output power are analyzed as well. For a specific configuration, the parameters for the thermophotovoltaic system are obtained, including short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor, total heat flux, output power and conversion efficiency. The proposed all-ceramic thermal emitter ensures the robustness in the high-temperature working condition due to its thermal stability. The tuning of emissivity is achieved and analyzed based on distinct emitter nanostructures, and the further influence on the thermophotovoltaic system performance is deeply explored. This work sheds light on research of high-temperature thermal management and power generation.},

	abstract = {Spectral distributions of radiative heat flux between two thin silicon carbide films separated by sub-wavelength distances in vacuum are analysed. An analytical expression for the near-field flux between two layers of finite thicknesses in terms of film reflection and transmission coefficients is derived for the first time. The resulting equation clearly shows the resonant modes of thermal emission, absorption and the cross-coupling of surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs) between the layers. When the films are of the same thickness, the resonant frequencies maximizing near-field thermal emission almost match those of absorption. The small discrepancies, due to SPhP coupling between the films, lead to loss of spectral coherence affecting mostly the low frequency mode. The flux profiles also show that splitting of the resonance into two distinct frequencies happens when the ratio thickness of the film over the separation gap is less than unity. When the thickness of one film increases relative to the other, spectral distributions of flux are significantly altered due to an important mismatch between the resonant frequencies of high emission and absorption. This modification of the near-field flux is mostly due to weaker SPhP coupling within the layer of increasing thickness. Based on an asymptotic analysis of the dispersion relation, an approximate approach is proposed to predict the resonant modes maximizing the flux between two films, which can be potentially extended to multiple thin layers. The outcome of this work would allow tailoring near-field radiative heat transfer, and can eventually be used to design customized nanostructures for energy harvesting applications.}

The method is based on the solution of dyadic Green's functions, where the amplitude of the fields in each layer is calculated via a scattering matrix approach. Several tests are presented where cubic boron nitride is used in the simulations. It is shown that a film emitter thicker than 1μm provides the same spectral distribution of near-field radiative flux as obtained from a bulk emitter. Further simulations have pointed out that the presence of a body in close proximity to an emitter can alter the near-field spectrum emitted. This algorithm can be employed to study thermal one-dimensional layered media and photonic crystals in the near-field in order to design radiators optimizing the performances of nanoscale-gap thermophotovoltaic power generators.}

ABSTRACT = {A huge concern regarding global warming, as well as the depletion of natural fuel resources, has led to a wide search for alternative energy sources. Due to their high reliability and long operation time, thermoelectric generators are of significant interest for waste heat recovery and power generation. The main disadvantage of TEGs is the low efficiency of thermoelectric commercial modules. In this work, a unique design for a multilayer TE unicouple is suggested for an operating temperature range of 50&ndash;600 &deg;C. Two types of thermoelectric materials were selected: &laquo;low temperature&raquo; n-and p-type TE materials (for the operating temperature range of 50&ndash;300 &deg;C) based on Bi2Te3 compounds and &laquo;middle temperature&raquo; (for the operating temperature range of 300&ndash;600 &deg;C) n- and p-type TE materials based on the PbTe compound. The hot extrusion technology was applied to fabricate n- and p-type low-temperature TE materials. A unique design of multilayer TEG was experienced to achieve an efficiency of up to 15\%. This allows for the possibility of extracting this amount of electrical power from the heat generated for domestic and water heating.},

	abstract = {Thermal radiation transfer between two objects separated by a subwavelength gap (near-field thermal radiation transfer) can be orders of magnitude larger than that in free space, which is attracting increasing attention with respect to both fundamental nanoscience and its potential for high-power-density and high-efficiency conversion of heat to electricity in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems. However, the realization of near-field thermal radiation transfer in TPV systems involves significant challenges because it requires a subwavelength gap and large temperature difference between the emitter and the PV cell while minimizing the heat transfer that does not contribute to the photocurrent generation. To overcome these challenges, here we demonstrate a one-chip near-field TPV device consisting of a thin-film Si emitter and InGaAs PV cell with an intermediate Si substrate, which enables the suppression of the heat transfer due to sub-bandgap radiation by free carriers and surface modes. Through the one-chip integration and thermal isolation using Si process technologies, we realize a deep subwavelength gap ({\textless}150 nm) between the emitter and the intermediate substrate without using any external positioners while maintaining a large temperature difference ({\textgreater}700 K). Compared to the equivalent device operating in the far-field regime, we achieve 10-fold enhancement of the photocurrent in the PV cell without degrading the open-circuit voltage and fill factor, demonstrating the potential of our one-chip device for the future applications of near-field thermal radiation transfer.},
